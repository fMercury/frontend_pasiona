Our team here at AXA is playing a fantasy role-playing game and every time the heroes they play arrive at a town, they have the issue they don't know the local population and what they can do to help them on their adventures. 

This is one of these times, our heroes just arrived at a Gnome town called Brastlewark. To facilitate trade with the local population they need an easy way to browse all the inhabitants details. We've found a server providing all the census data of Brastlewark at the following address: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrafols/mobile_test/master/data.json

Gnomes in this town are not really social because they have too much work to do. That's the reason they can have more than one job and might have few or even no friends at all. They also appreciate their privacy so they've used some random images from internet, not specifically optimized for mobile devices, for their profile. (They are very modern in some aspects and they have smartphones and access to internet for instance).

High level specifications

* Retrieve data from the URL provided. It is provided as an static json, ut assume it might change randomly.
* Show this data in the most user-friendly way you could think. Keep in mind our heroes will be quite busy dealing with Orcs, so the app has to be really simple and easy to use. At least, it would be good to quickly browse (and even filter) all the individuals and be able to see the details of each one.
